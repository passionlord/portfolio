              In my life, I like to do lot of activities those activities help
              me exercise and made me feel alive, and my favorite activity is
              cooking because cooking is very simple. I started to cook when I
              was in about high school , when I was home alone all by myself and
              I was pretty hungry, I just got some ingredients, some egg and put
              it in a mix and made some delicious dishes. Since then I had been
              cooking my own food when I was home or I have a lot of free time.

              Creativity is my first dexterity. It has been my interest creating
              UI designs to experiment them and to eventually build them , I
              loved it. I loved the thrill. I love to see my imagination come to
              life. I loved gadgets. I choose to be a web designer to bring my
              ideas to life and help others see what I think a better world
              looks like. Designing something is like a rainbow with various
              colors it brightens the mind .
